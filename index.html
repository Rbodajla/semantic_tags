    <h2>Canada to the United States</h2>
  <article>
    <p>I grew up in a small city called Fredericton, New Brunswick Canada.
      Where I loved playing High School sports which included Soccer, Basketball
      and Volleyball. It was my childhood dream to play College Basketball in
      the United States. In 2011 my family and I moved to Norwood, Massachusetts
      for my parents career and not my basketball career.</p>

    <h2>Priorities:Sports vs. Educations</h2>
    <p> I completed High School and College in Massachusetts and had the
      opportunity to play Division III Basketball and Lacrosse. Education became
      my primary focus and obtaining my Master's Degree in Global Supply Chain
      Management at Maine Maritime Academybecame my number one focus.</P>

    <h2>Career Trials and Tribulations</h2>
    <p> After graduating I decided to move to Long Beach, California and purse
      my career as a Longshoreman Superintendent. I quickly realized this wasn't
      my long term career. I switched my focus to Warehouse Management and
      then Leadership Development for Kraft Foods and Amazon. I had the wonderful
      opportunity to work and live all over the United States.Connecticut,
      Nevada, Tennessee, Indiana, California, Texas and Washington. I have lived
      in Seattle for the past 2 years and now consider the Pacific Northwest Home.</P>

    <h2>Life Isn't Just About Work</h2>
    <p> In my spare time I enjoy traveling around the world, exploring the Pacific
      Northwest, Downhill skiing/touring, and the most important thing...
      spending time with my family, friends and cats.</p>
